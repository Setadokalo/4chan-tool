After years of fighting with configuration management systems that seemed bound and determined to go backwards from where we were in 2007 I gave up and just wrote my own system from scratch using Python.  It isn&#039;t pretty and I made some mistakes in the design but it&#039;s still way better to work with than puppet, ansible, or chef.<br><br>It&#039;s not general-purpose.  It&#039;s specifically tailored to solve the problems I have.  I&#039;ve encountered a few idempotency issues but nothing serious (in fact I still haven&#039;t bothered to fix the biggest one I found since it&#039;s such a trivial thing).  Plus I can easily integrate some features like having every configuration update check the important parts into a local git repo.  So if I want to see the history of changes on any given server I can just browse to \/etc\/&lt;myshit&gt;\/config and use standard git commands to browse the history and can even check in temporary manual modifications for troubleshooting.  It&#039;s much nicer than whatever puppet&#039;s custom lock-in feature alternative is.  Which incidentally caused problems as it was bucketing &quot;ssh_known_hosts&quot; every single time it changed, for a huge cluster where nodes were constantly being added and removed.  And it wasn&#039;t doing it in any kind of compressed or diff-based way there were just fucking thousands of useless copies of this file stored on the disks of every single node in the cluster.  Nobody told puppet to do this on purpose.  It happened automatically when someone installed some standard puppet module.<br><br>Anyway back to the point, is that the total amount of &quot;reinventing the wheel badly&quot; that I did for my project amounts to about 500 lines of code (that includes the git wrappers).  I won&#039;t deny it&#039;s a badly reinvented wheel but it hasn&#039;t caused problems.
